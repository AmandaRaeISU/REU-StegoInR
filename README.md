# Steganography in R

Please find as many resources (books, blogs, R packages, etc.) as you can relating to performing stego tasks that you do in MatLab in R. Google, CRAN Task Views, StackOverflow, and GitHub are all good places to start. 

Supplement your findings with lots of examples. i.e. if you find an R package, show your readers how to use it. If you find a blog post, run through their examples with another picture. If you find a book, check it out from the Parks library and work through some problems, documenting your work on this repo. 

We want as much of your research with CSAFE as possible to be open to the public so others can recreate and verify what you do. This is the goal of *reproducible research*. Finding stego in R resources is now a part of that. 

By the end of the summer, anyone looking for steganalysis resources in R should find this repo and consider it a "one-stop shop" for all things stego.
